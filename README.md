#Robo Markdown

###My first React / Webpack project

React is cool. Webpack is AMAZING!!!

You can write markdown in the right side and see it rendered live in Github style on the left side.

Oh and you can hit tab while editing and actually get an indent instead of losing focus on the textarea.

yeah thats basically it for now.
